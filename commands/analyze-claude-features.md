# Analyze Claude Features

Read and analyze each documentation source below, then assess what can be concretely applied or improved in this project.

**Sources — cache-first loading:**

Local cache: `~/.claude/docs/claude-code/` — read files from here first using the Read tool.
If a cached file is missing, fetch from the fallback URL instead.
If `~/.claude/docs/claude-code/.last-sync` is older than 14 days, warn: "Docs cache is stale. Run `bash scripts/sync-docs.sh` to refresh."
If no cache exists at all, fetch all URLs below directly.

Grades: A (90-100), B (70-89), C (50-69), D (30-49), F (0-29). Target: **100/100**.

Score breakdown:

- **Source coverage 15/15:** All 14 sources read, key concepts extracted, no source skipped
- **10/15:** ≥12 sources, minor gaps. **5/15:** <10 sources or superficial extraction
- **Context verification 15/15:** All dirs/files/configs verified via tool output, zero assumptions
- **10/15:** Most verified, 1-2 assumptions noted. **5/15:** Multiple unverified claims
- **Gap analysis depth 15/15:** Every source checked against project, evidence-linked, false negatives caught
- **10/15:** Most sources checked, some shallow. **5/15:** Surface-level comparison only
- **Decision matrix accuracy 15/15:** Every config correctly classified, misplacements caught and flagged
- **10/15:** Matrix applied but 1-2 items unchecked. **5/15:** Matrix not systematically applied
- **Traceability 15/15:** Every recommendation chains: Source → Gap → Opportunity → Recommendation
- **10/15:** Most chain, some orphaned. **5/15:** Recommendations without clear source linkage
- **Actionability 15/15:** Every recommendation has specific files, commands, or config changes
- **10/15:** Mostly concrete, some vague. **5/15:** Generic suggestions without file paths
- **Prioritization quality 10/10:** Impact×Effort scored, quick wins separated, dependencies mapped
- **7/10:** Scored but dependencies unclear. **3/10:** Subjective ranking without criteria

Critical minimum thresholds — any criterion below its min → must fix before final score:

| Criterion | Min |
| --- | --- |
| Source coverage | 10/15 |
| Context verification | 10/15 |
| Gap analysis depth | 10/15 |
| Decision matrix accuracy | 10/15 |

## Thinking Process (follow in order)

**Step 1 — Comprehend Sources**
For each source, extract: core concept, key capabilities, and intended use cases.

Checklist:

- [ ] features-overview.md — decision matrix, feature comparison, context costs
- [ ] skills.md — frontmatter fields, substitutions, bundled skills, `context: fork`
- [ ] sub-agents.md — configuration, tools, memory, hooks, isolation
- [ ] output-styles.md — frontmatter, `keep-coding-instructions`, built-in styles
- [ ] memory.md — CLAUDE.md scoping, `.claude/rules/`, `@import`, auto memory, `claudeMdExcludes`
- [ ] settings.md — settings hierarchy, all fields, environment variables
- [ ] permissions.md — allow/deny/ask rules, tool-specific syntax, managed settings
- [ ] hooks-guide.md — hook types, lifecycle events, patterns
- [ ] hooks.md — all event schemas, input/output formats, exit codes
- [ ] scheduled-tasks.md — `/loop`, cron scheduling
- [ ] plugins.md — plugin manifest, packaging, distribution, marketplaces
- [ ] mcp.md — MCP server config, tool search, scope hierarchy
- [ ] agent-teams.md — team coordination, shared tasks, messaging
- [ ] Notion BestPractice — 5 golden rules, skill brief template, anti-patterns

---

**Step 2 — Audit Project Structure (carefully)**
Do NOT assume or infer structure. Verify everything.

Checklist:

- [ ] Read CLAUDE.md — architecture, conventions, declared constraints
- [ ] Verify top-level directory structure via listing
- [ ] Confirm tech stack from package.json / config files (not assumption)
- [ ] Locate and review existing scripts, hooks, automation files
- [ ] Check `.claude/settings.json` — existing hooks, permissions, env vars
- [ ] Check for `.claude/rules/` directory — path-specific rules
- [ ] Check for CI/CD config files (.github/, Jenkinsfile, etc.)
- [ ] Note anything unconfirmed as [UNVERIFIED]

---

**Step 3 — Identify Confirmed Context**
Before gap analysis, explicitly state only what is verified:

Checklist:

- [ ] Tech stack confirmed (language, framework, runtime versions)
- [ ] Project structure mapped (key directories and their roles)
- [ ] Existing workflows identified (scripts, hooks, CI/CD)
- [ ] Known pain points captured (from CLAUDE.md, README, or comments)
- [ ] All [UNVERIFIED] items listed with reason

---

**Quality Gate 1 — Context Completeness**
Do NOT proceed to gap analysis until all checks pass:

| Check | Pass Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Sources fetched | ≥12 of 14 sources successfully read |
| CLAUDE.md read | Full file read (not skimmed) |
| Directory verified | `tree` or `ls` output captured |
| Settings checked | `.claude/settings.json` content confirmed |
| Unverified items | All listed with reason |

Gate: PASS ✅ or FAIL ❌ — resolve failures before continuing.

---

**Step 4 — Gap Analysis**
Compare each source's capabilities against confirmed context only.
Do NOT propose improvements based on assumed or unverified state.

Checklist:

- [ ] features-overview — is the right feature used for each concern? (CLAUDE.md vs rules vs skills)
- [ ] skills — frontmatter fields, substitutions, bundled skills adoption
- [ ] sub-agents — agent configuration, memory, hooks, isolation
- [ ] output-styles — styles coverage, `keep-coding-instructions` usage
- [ ] memory & rules — `.claude/rules/` for path-specific instructions, `@import` syntax, `CLAUDE.local.md`
- [ ] settings — env vars, config fields not yet used
- [ ] permissions — allow/deny/ask rules in settings.json
- [ ] hooks — all event types vs. currently configured hooks
- [ ] scheduled-tasks — recurring workflows that could use `/loop`
- [ ] plugins — packaging opportunity for distribution
- [ ] mcp — external tool integration gaps
- [ ] agent-teams — coordination needs (experimental — note stability)
- [ ] BestPractice — skill quality, description triggers

---

**Step 5 — Decision Matrix Validation**
For each existing configuration, verify it uses the right feature type:

| Content Type | Should Be | Not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Always do X" rules | CLAUDE.md | skill |
| Path-specific guidelines | `.claude/rules/` with `paths` | CLAUDE.md (bloat) |
| Reference docs loaded sometimes | skill | CLAUDE.md (always loaded) |
| Repeatable workflows | skill with `disable-model-invocation` | CLAUDE.md |
| Deterministic automation | hook | skill or agent |
| External service access | MCP | bash scripts |

Flag any misplacement found.

---

**Step 6 — Opportunity Mapping**
For each confirmed gap, define: what to change, add, or automate — and which files/areas it affects.

Checklist:

- [ ] Each opportunity linked to a specific confirmed gap
- [ ] Affected files or areas identified
- [ ] No opportunity from [UNVERIFIED] context without conditional flag

---

**Quality Gate 2 — Opportunity Validity**
Verify each opportunity before prioritizing:

| Check | Pass Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence-linked | Every opportunity traces to a specific gap |
| No duplicates | No two opportunities address the same gap |
| Feasibility | Affected files/paths confirmed to exist |
| Not already done | Feature not already implemented |
| Conditional flagged | [UNVERIFIED]-based opportunities marked |

Remove or merge opportunities that fail. Gate: PASS ✅ or FAIL ❌.

---

**Step 7 — Prioritize**
Score each opportunity: Impact (H/M/L) × Effort (H/M/L) → rank and justify.

Checklist:

- [ ] Every opportunity scored on Impact and Effort
- [ ] Final ranking justified with reasoning
- [ ] Quick wins (Low Effort / High Impact) highlighted separately

---

**Step 8 — Recommend**
Propose a sequenced adoption plan: what to implement first, why, and what it unlocks next.
Flag any recommendation that depends on [UNVERIFIED] context as conditional.

Checklist:

- [ ] Adoption sequence with clear ordering rationale
- [ ] Dependencies between recommendations explicit
- [ ] Conditional recommendations flagged
- [ ] Quick wins highlighted separately

---

**Step 9 — Verify & Score**
Validate the final output, then score.

Verification checklist:

- [ ] **Source coverage** — every source appears in gap analysis or has "no gap found" note
- [ ] **Traceability** — each recommendation chains: Source → Gap → Opportunity → Recommendation
- [ ] **No phantom features** — all referenced files/paths verified to exist (or marked "to create")
- [ ] **Decision matrix consistent** — no recommendation contradicts Step 5
- [ ] **No stale references** — URLs, file paths, config keys all current
- [ ] **Completeness** — no source silently dropped between steps

Score each criterion (mandatory output format):

```markdown
| Criterion | Score | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source coverage | XX/15 | ✅ or ⚠️ CRITICAL (if <10) | ... |
| Context verification | XX/15 | ✅ or ⚠️ CRITICAL (if <10) | ... |
| Gap analysis depth | XX/15 | ✅ or ⚠️ CRITICAL (if <10) | ... |
| Decision matrix accuracy | XX/15 | ✅ or ⚠️ CRITICAL (if <10) | ... |
| Traceability | XX/15 | ✅ | ... |
| Actionability | XX/15 | ✅ | ... |
| Prioritization quality | XX/10 | ✅ | ... |

Total: XX/100 (Grade X)
Critical check: PASS ✅ — all criteria above minimums
— or —
Critical check: FAIL ⚠️ — [Criterion] at X/15 (min 10)
```

If FAIL → go back to the failing step and fix before re-scoring.

## Output

Per-source summary (Step 1), gap analysis table (Step 4), decision matrix validation (Step 5), top improvements with rationale, recommended adoption sequence with dependencies, and verification + score (Step 9) with per-criterion breakdown. Target: 100/100.
