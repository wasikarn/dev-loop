# Research Validator

Structural gate check on research.md before Phase 1 → Phase 2 transition. Validates that explorers
produced concrete evidence, not just section headers.

## Steps

### 1. Locate research.md

Read `.claude/dlc-build/research.md`. If not found, output `FAIL: research.md not found at
.claude/dlc-build/research.md` and exit.

### 2. Check Required Sections

Verify these sections exist (case-insensitive heading match):

- `## Architecture` or `## Codebase` or `## Structure` — overview of relevant code areas
- `## Relevant Files` or `## Files` or `## Affected Files` — list of files to modify
- `## Patterns` or `## Conventions` or `## Approach` — how similar things are done in the project
- `## Risks` or `## Concerns` or `## Edge Cases` — potential issues (may be absent if task is trivial)

### 3. Count file:line Evidence

Count occurrences of `file:line` patterns in research.md:

Pattern: any path ending in `.<ext>` followed by `:` and a line number (e.g., `src/user.ts:42`,
`app/services/auth.service.ts:115`).

Minimum required: **5 file:line references** for non-trivial tasks.

### 4. Check for Empty Sections

Flag any section heading that is immediately followed by another heading or end-of-file with no
content between them (empty section body).

### 5. Output Verdict

```markdown
## Research Validation

**Result:** PASS | FAIL
**File:line references found:** {count} (minimum: 5)

### Issues
- Missing section: "Relevant Files" — explorers must identify which files to modify
- Empty section: "## Risks" has no content
- Insufficient evidence: only 2 file:line references found

### Passing Checks
- ✅ Architecture section present with content
- ✅ Patterns section present with content
```

On PASS, output only the summary line and passing checks (no issues table).
On FAIL, lead should re-dispatch the relevant explorer with a targeted prompt before proceeding to
Phase 2.
