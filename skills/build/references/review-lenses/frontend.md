FRONTEND LENS (active for this review):

RSC / APP ROUTER BOUNDARY (Next.js App Router — flag when `app/` dir or `'use client'` present):
- `'use client'` on a parent that only passes data down → move boundary to leaf; reduces client JS
- Server Component importing a Client Component that re-imports a Server Component → RSC-in-CC
  island breaks; extract inner SC as `children` or slot prop
- Default export in `app/` without explicit `'use client'` but uses hooks/events → will error at runtime
- Missing `'use server'` on Server Action handling sensitive ops → treated as client code, security risk
- Server Action without input validation → user-controlled data reaches server unvalidated
- `cache: 'no-store'` missing on user-specific `fetch()` in Server Component → stale shared cache across users

HYDRATION:
- `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` / `new Date()` in render path (outside `useEffect`) → hydration mismatch
- Browser-only API (`window`, `document`, `localStorage`) accessed outside `useEffect` without
  `typeof window !== 'undefined'` guard → SSR crash
- Dynamic content (personalization, timestamps) rendered in SSR without deferred mount pattern
  Fix: `const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false); useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);`
- `suppressHydrationWarning` used without comment explaining why → masks real hydration bugs

STREAMING & SUSPENSE:
- Async Server Component without `<Suspense fallback={...}>` → entire route blocks on slowest fetch
- Multiple independent data fetches in one component → split across components with Suspense boundaries
  (parallel streams vs waterfall)
- Missing `loading.tsx` for route segments with async data → no user feedback during navigation
- `<Suspense>` wrapping a Client Component that fetches with `useEffect` → Suspense only works with
  `use()` hook or async Server Component; `useEffect` fetch not suspended

REACT PATTERNS:
- Waterfall requests: sequential `await` in Server Component where `Promise.all` enables parallelism
- Barrel imports: `import { X } from 'lib'` pulling entire index → prefer direct path imports
- Missing error boundaries: async operations without `error.tsx` (App Router) or `<ErrorBoundary>`
- Hook violations: hooks inside conditions/loops, missing dependency arrays in `useEffect`/`useCallback`
- Prop drilling: data passed through 3+ component levels → consider context or composition
- `setState` in `useEffect` with missing/unstable deps → infinite re-render or stale closure
- Missing `key` props: lists without stable keys, index-as-key on reorderable lists

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Interactive elements (`div onClick`, `span onClick`) missing `role`, `tabIndex`, keyboard handler
- Images missing `alt` attribute or using non-descriptive alt text (e.g., `alt="image"`)
- Color as sole information carrier (no text/icon alternative)
- Form inputs without associated `<label>` or `aria-label`
```
